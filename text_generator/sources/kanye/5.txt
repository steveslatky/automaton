Believe it or not
Believe it or not
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Take the top off, let the sun come in
Woah, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again yeah
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Haan? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off!"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
Believe it or not
These two wrongs'll right you
I was too grown in high school
The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you
Truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you
Too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you make no
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you no way
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you no way
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
